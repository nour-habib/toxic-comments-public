## Things to test/TODO

LSTM

Bidirectional LSTM

LSTM + GLoVE embeddings

LSTM + BERT Embeddings

Simple RNN

Bidirectional RNN

GRU

BiDirectional GRU

CNN?

Fully connected network

Naive Bayes Linear Regression

N-Gram counting?


Normalized hyperparameters vs hyperparameters individually tuned?

Normalized RNN architectures?

Get incorrect validation predictions, which classifications does the network struggle on?

If the accuracy is high on all of them, we can compare loss?
